# N-ary Category encoder

This encodes categorical values into a number in a compact expression using the n-ary system.

# Principle

If something has n categories and each has m subcategories at most, give a number to each subcategory and assign each number to each digit of a m-ary number. So the number has n digits. This is how the information is encoded. The experiment using test data has shown that the number of bytes necessary for expressing the data was reduced by 67% by this encoding method. This work might be beneficial for making QR codes used for managing products in manufacturers.
